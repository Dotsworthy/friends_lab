# CodeClan paired lab for week 1 day 4
based on the following brief:

We have a bunch of information about a set of friends. We're going to find out some interesting information about them using TDD.

We need to to complete the tasks in the comments of the friends_spec.rb file. Write your tests in that file first, then write the function to pass the test in friends.rb. There is one example test and function already. If you get stuck, there are hints on how to approach the problem for each question.
